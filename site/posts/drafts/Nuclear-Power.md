title: Nuclear Power is Weird
---

Nuclear power is weird.
As a practical matter, it's safe, efficient, and produces no emissions.[^_emissions]
These are things I _know_ to be true.
I _know_ that it's one of, if not the most, realistic ways of completely eliminating carbon emissions from power generation.
I _know_ that the general fear of nuclear power is pretty overblown.
And I _know_ that nuclear power really freaks me out.

Why is that?
It's at least partially because I know how a nuclear reactor works---on the most basic, theoretical, big-picture level.[^_works]
Generating power from nuclear fission, which is the way all existing reactors work, is not too dissimilar to exploding a nuclear bomb, just a lot slower.

&hellip;

[^_emissions]: No emissions besides, you know, the waste product---we'll get into that later.
[^_works]: Really can't stress enough that my knowledge of this stuff is rudimentary (if I'm being generous).
