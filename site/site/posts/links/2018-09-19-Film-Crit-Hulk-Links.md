{% from "link_macro.njk" import link_heading %}

There are so many articles that I could link here.[^1]
Like the at [least]({{ page.links.speed1 }}) [three]({{ page.links.speed2 }}) [articles]({{ page.links.speed3 }}) that Hulk has written on **Speed Racer**, or the fascinating [Wakaliwood]({{ page.links.wakali }}) piece, or the [__Nightcrawler__]({{ page.links.night }}) article on character arcs, or the [Jonathan Gold]({{ page.links.gold }}) eulogy; I really could go on and on.[^6]
Because of the surfeit of candidates, I decided to ignore my unwritten/unspoken/unnecessary rule of five and this post includes six links.

Anyways, Hulk excels at articulating things that I feel intuitively, but are stuck in the primordial soup of my brain, unable to make that final step towards life.
He, not to put too fine or dramatic a point on it, is like the lightning that finally woke up the oozing puddle of proteins that finally became the first life.

The oppressors[^5] are the only group in an oppressive system with the actual capacity to effect change; slaves could not emancipate themselves and women could not grant suffrage to themselves.
But in order for change to be effected, those who benefit from the system, who are often blind to its (the system's) existence, must take care to heed the outcry, to accept that their reality is not universal.

{{ link_heading(links.gadsby) }}
It took me a while to actually watch **Nanette**, I knew that it got pretty real at some point, but I didn't know that it was going to be so cutting.

{{ link_heading(links.female) }}
I mentioned this article in a previous post, but it's so gosh dang good that I couldn't resist linking it here.
I mean, it starts with an incredible point regarding the misguided "logic" with which so many people analyze movies.
And it just gets better from there.

{{ link_heading(links.starwars) }}
Articulated in this article are, _inter alia_, the feelings that I have regarding things[^2] that I have liked by myself in the past, but are now generally accepted and lauded.
Obviously, the "thing" in this instance is **Star Wars** and its legion of entitled, maladjusted, incel-lite,[^3] man-baby fanboys[^4].

{{ link_heading(links.cinematic) }}

[^1]: And desperately want to, but for the sake of the readers, and my own, I will desist.
[^2]: Films, video games, TV shows, media generally.
[^3]: If you don't know what an incel is, first off, lucky you, and to get up to speed on what that means, read [this _Vox_ article](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/4/25/17277496/incel-toronto-attack-alek-minassian) and/or watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-gX0spJpa0), and prepare to be horrified and disgusted.
[^4]: This might be a tad harsh, but a lot of their commentary and criticisms of **The Last Jedi** sounds disturbingly close to what incels say about the world generally.
[^5]: By which I mean white people and males, who are, if not actively oppressing, at least the beneficiaries of an oppresive system.
[^6]: Linking all those feels vaguely like cheating.
