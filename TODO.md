# TODO

## Actual Things to do

- Use compiled scripts and configs (they run faster)
  - Use `build/scripts/build-sw.js` to build the service worker
  - Use `build/webpack.config.js` as the webpack config
- Maybe switch the body and header fonts (make "Fira Sans" the body font and "Spectral" the header font).
- Get rid of more includes that are only used once
  - [ ] `header.njk`
  - [ ] `nav.njk`
